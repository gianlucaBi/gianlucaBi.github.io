== Recent Updates
I am excited to announce our upcoming workshop [https://gianlucabi.github.io/ACC23/ Online Optimization for Data-Driven Control] that will be offered at the [https://acc2023.a2c2.org 2023 American Control Conference] in San Diego, which I am co-organizing with Emiliano Dall'Anese, Jorge Cortes, and Miguel Vaquero. 



== Openings
{{<font color=red size=+0.5><b>}} I am actively looking for PhDs/Postdocs to work in the areas of data-driven control, network control, and autonomous transportation! A strong mathematical background is required. To apply, please see [https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/71485 this opening].{{</b></font>}}


== Short Bio 
I am an Assistant Professor in the ICTEAM Institute at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain. 
From 2020 to 2022, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/ Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering] at the University of Colorado Boulder.
I completed the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at the [https://www.me.ucr.edu University of California Riverside] in 2020. Before joining UC Riverside, I received an M.Sc. degree in Controls Engineering and a B.Sc. degree in Information Engineering from the [https://www.unipd.it/en/ University of Padova] in 2014 and 2012, respectively.


== Research Interests 
My main research interests are in the modeling, analysis, and control of large-scale interconnected systems, with an application focus on transportation networks.

Topics of current interest:
- Use of optimization algorithms for the control of dynamical systems
- Control of Mobility-on-Demand systems and transportation networks
- Security in cyber-physical systems

- \[Mar 23\] In our recent paper "[PAPERS/GB-23-lcss.pdf Data-Driven Exact Pole Placement for Linear Systems]" we show that the closed-loop poles of a linear system can be placed exactly at arbitrary locations without relying on any model description but by using only finite-length trajectories generated by the open-loop system!
- \[Sept 22\] My [https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/2022/09/16/former-ecee-postdoc-i-aim-be-effective-engaging-and-inspiring-educator interview] for the CU Boulder College of Engineering is a great summary of two amazing years spent at CU and a farewell to the beautiful Boulder, CO
- \[Aug 22\] In our recent paper "[PAPERS/GB-MV-JC-ED-22-tac.pdf k-Dimensional Agreement in Multiagent Systems]" we study how a group of distributed agents can compute k independent weighted means of a common vector by running a single distributed algorithm. We hope this algorithm will be utilized in distributed computing problems where agents are interested in evaluating k independent functions at a common point!
