										<h2>Optimal Steady-State Control</h2>
									</header>
									<p align="justify">We consider the problem of designing feedback controllers which robustly regulate the inputs and outputs of a linear time-invariant dynamic system to the solution of a steady-state constrained optimization problem. Inspired by traditional approaches for reference tracking and disturbance rejection, we outline a constructive design framework for this problem which we call optimal steady-state control. The key idea in the approach is that a representation of the steady-state optimality conditions should be embedded in the feedback loop. Ideas from robust and nonlinear control can be leveraged to obtain closed-loop stability certificates, and practically-minded low-gain controller designs are discussed. The framework is illustrated with applications to modernized frequency control in power transmission systems.
