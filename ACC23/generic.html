								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p align="justify">Over the past decade, considerable research effort 
									has been devoted to the development and synthesis of 
									control algorithms that are inspired by optimization 
									algorithms. 
									These activities are motivated by the fundamental observation that in 
									many control applications - with examples in the control of 
									transportation systems, power networks, robotic systems, and epidemic 
									models - it is necessary to control physical systems to optimal setpoints 
									and 
									simultaneously update these setpoints during runtime by taking into 
									account for several optimality requirements, such as system efficiency, 
									user satisfaction, and minimality of the control effort. 
								</p>
								<p align="justify">From this background, it is increasingly evident that physical 
									From this background, it is increasingly evident that physical 
									systems and dynamical optimization algorithms are becoming 
									progressively integrated and that optimization algorithms play a key 
									role in future control paradigms, and thus their behavior needs to be 
									taken into account fundamentally when designing modern autonomous and 
									intelligent systems.
									These practical motivations and research questions have led to a 
									flourishing research field that has received considerable attention 
									during the past decade, with contributions from several research 
									communities (including Controls, Optimization, and Machine Learning) 
									and many research groups worldwide. </p>
								<h2>Objectives</h2>
								<p align="justify">This workshop aims to report recent research achievements in the use 
									of online optimization algorithms for feedback control and to identify 
									emerging research challenges in the area. 
									The workshop willconstruct around two 
									central themes: (i) the synthesis of feedback optimization methods 
									using data-driven (or model-free) techniques - which broadly includes 
									the use of techniques from data-driven control as well as the use of 
									derivative-free methods from optimization - and (ii) the adoption of 
									feedback optimization methods for the control of systems with a 
									network structure. 
									</p>
									The main goals of this workshop are as follows:
									<ol>
										<li>to provide a brief tutorial for students and researchers on feedback optimization techniques</li>
										<li>to give an overview of ongoing research activities, and present recent research results in the area</li>
										<li>to discuss open challenges and highly promising research directions</li>
									  </ol>
								<h2>Target Audience</h2>
								<p>We invite all interested students, researchers, and practicioners from both the 
									industry and academia that are interested in interdisciplinary 
									studies at the interface of control theory, optimization theory, and 
									computer science. </p>
